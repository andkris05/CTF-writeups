'Welcome, Detective! 
You've just opened your very own private detective bureau, and today, your first case has landed on your desk. 
A woman with a thick German accent called and, in true German fashion, faxed you a document. 
She's searching for someone and needs your help in finding out what the tattoo of that person says. 
Sadly the fax machine has seen better days and the fax is incomplete.

Apparently, this isn't just any missing person caseâ€”it's part of an elaborate treasure hunt. 
She mentioned something about an ancient secret society, cryptic symbols hidden in plain sight, and a puzzle 
that has remained unsolved for centuries. You however dont care about that. Your only task is to find the tattoo on 
the misterious persons skin.

For this challenge, we are met with an image that seems to contain excerpts of a german sentence, although being obviously
incomplete. On the bottom of our image, we can see the text 'Poongo', as well as a date: '01.07.1970'. 
It's not immediately obvious what the meaning of the poster might be. However, with a given amount of german knowledge,
it's possible to make out the word 'Steuerhinterziehung', which translates to tax evasion. After googling a few combinations,
I was able to find what I needed by searching the combination 'steuerhinterziehung 01.07.1970'.

Look! Here's an article from Rheinland Pfalz Polizei! And it even has the name Poongodi!

Apperantly there's a manhunt because of serious tax evasion. Either way, if we scroll down a little, we can find a link
that contains more information on her. Again, if we scroll down a little more on this page, we can find a link that says
'Weitere Informationen', or more information.

It is here where we can find out what her tattoo says.
